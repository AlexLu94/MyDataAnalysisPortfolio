# My data analysis portfolio

## About

This is a collection of data analysis projects on which I worked in my free time.
I created these notebooks mainly as a hands-on way to learn new techniques and get to know new Python libraries. 
I am now (slowly) reviewing the code and publishing it as a sort of *portfolio* of my skills.
 
## How to navigate

Each folder contains a project.
Each project contains a single notebook named 'analysis.ipynb'.
The first cells of the notebooks always contain a markdown summary of the analysis, while the subsequent cells contain the code.

## A quick look
